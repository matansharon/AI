1. General
1.1. Project Name: 
1.2. Project ID#: PRS-0003
Project Description: The GNTP Injector Pen is an electro-mechanical reusable auto-injector (AI) pen for use with GNTP drug for subcutaneous injection.
The product elements include a reusable injection device and a disposable cartridge.
2. Purpose
2.1. This Test Method Validation Master Plan (TM VMP) serves as a summary of the overall strategy and outlines the validation activities to establish TM used in Genotropin Injector pen Device test plan

3. Scope
This VMP will cover the overall strategy for the validation activities to be performed by E3D to establish TM used in the device test plan for the following products:

NameCATFrenly Device391773GH COACH Device391774

7.1. Elementary and Self-Evident Test Methods do not require a TMV
7.2. For standard test methods (tests based on scientific principles and are included in recognized standard) a test method validation is not required. 
7.3. All PRD requirements concerning software (e.g. visual/audio checks) test method validations are not required as these will be validated as part of the software validation
7.4. For non-standard methods, laboratory-developed methods and standard methods used outside of the supplier scope that are not covered by sections? 5.1- ?5.3, a Test method validation will be performed (see list below).
7.5. Minor changes may be addressed by the project team and summarized in the validation report. Deviations/changes from the plan that require a change in the validation strategy and or plan will be communicated and agreed upon with the customer.
