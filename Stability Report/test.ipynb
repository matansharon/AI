      "\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------\n",
      "1. Executive Summary  \n",
      "-------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Purpose – A design-verification programme (PRJ-0695) was executed after the septum material used in Elcam’s NIP Stand-Alone Luer-Activated Valve (LAV) was changed from Dow-Corning QP1-50 to SILPURAN® 6000/50 A+B (new PN 590422). The central objective was to confirm long-term stability and establish an approved shelf-life for products containing the new silicone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key stability activities –  \n",
      "• Accelerated-aging per ASTM F-1980-21 (Q10 = 2.0, 50 days @ 52 °C ≈ 1 year).  \n",
      "• Oven programmes chosen to simulate ~1 month, 2 years and 5 years at both 52 °C and 60 °C (Table 4.7.3).  \n",
      "• Worst-case focus group: F5-5-60-EG – 5 years equivalent, 60 °C for 141 days, sterilised 40 kGy γ (actual range 42.9-47.4 kGy) + 2 ETO cycles.  \n",
      "• Supporting groups covered 25 kGy γ + ETO, ETO-only and real-time storage (2 & 5 years per protocol Doc-332257).\n",
      "\n",
      "Critical stability results (Group F5 vs. legacy Group C4) –  \n",
      "• Visual / slit integrity: no closures or defects after >40 kGy γ (7.1).  \n",
      "• Leakage tests (air & liquid, sub-atm., back-pressure, 11-day activation): no failures (7.4, 7.5, 7.10, 7.15-7.16).  \n",
      "• Burst pressure: 45 ± 3 psi (F5) vs. 43 ± 2.5 psi (C4); both >30 psi spec (7.7).  \n",
      "• Flow rate: 368 ml min-1 (F5) vs. 363 ml min-1 (C4); spec ≥120 ml min-1 (7.8).  \n",
      "• Activation force after aging/40 kGy: 22.5 N (max 23.5 N) – below 30 N limit (7.17).  \n",
      "• All other functional, dimensional, particulate and lipid-exposure checks passed.  \n",
      "• Microbial-ingress testing (external lab, Doc-330808) in progress; no deviations reported to date.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall conclusion – After simulated 5-year aging under worst-case sterilisation, every measured attribute met AAMI ISO CN27-2021, ISO 80369-7 and ISO 8536-4 acceptance criteria. The new septum material showed higher resistance to tearing and retained sealing even after ≥42.8 kGy γ (Section 8.2). Elcam therefore recommends and approves a 5-year shelf-life for all products containing septum PN 590422 following up to 42.8 kGy gamma irradiation and two ETO cycles (Recommendation 10.1).\n",

      "2. Introduction  \n",
      "-------------------------------------------------\n",
      "2.1 Rationale and Objectives  \n",
      "Dow Corning’s QP1-50 LSR was discontinued, prompting replacement with Wacker’s SILPURAN® 6000/50 A+B. Because Elcam is design-owner of the Stand-Alone NIP (PN 220808), repeated design verification—including stability/aging—was mandated (CCB ECO-24-0005). The study evaluates whether the new silicone maintains product performance throughout intended shelf-life and worst-case sterilisation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.2 Product Context  \n",
      "• Product: NIP Stand-Alone LAV assembly PN 220808L; septum PN 590422; cap PN 530145; MLLC body PN 210810L.  \n",
      "• Comparator: Current production NIP PN 220808 using septum PN 590408.  \n",
      "• Functional role: valved female Luer port used in various LAV products.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.3 Regulatory & Standard Framework  \n",
      "• AAMI ISO CN27-2021 (Performance requirements for Luer-Activated Valves).  \n",
      "• ISO 80369-7, ISO 8536-4, USP <788> particulates.  \n",
      "• Accelerated Aging – ASTM F-1980-21 (SOP 3-01-39).  \n",
      "• Gamma/ETO sterilisation – SOP 4-01-20; dosimetry data in Sorvan report (Section 6.2.4).\n",
