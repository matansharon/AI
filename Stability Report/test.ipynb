      "1. Summary (Executive Summary)  \n",
      "The stability evaluation described in “Silicon Change on NIP valve – Design Verification & Validation Report, Doc-331335, Rev. A, 06-Apr-2025” was performed to confirm that replacing the silicone septum material with SILPURAN® 6000/50 A+B (septum PN 590422) does not compromise long-term performance of Elcam’s Stand-Alone NIP Luer-Activated Valve (product PN 220808L) and associated devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accelerated-aging regimens (section 4.7) were chosen to simulate real-time storage of up to five years.  Test groups were exposed to:\n",
      "• 52 °C for 7, 98 and 245 days (≈ 1 month, 2 years, 5 years)  \n",
      "• 60 °C for 29, 57 and 141 days (≈ 1 year, 2 years, 5 years)  \n",
      "\n",
      "The most severe configuration (Group F5-5-60-EG: 40 kGy Gamma, 2×EtO, 141 days @ 60 °C = 5 years) was selected as the primary stability challenge.  Functional, dimensional and safety tests defined in AAMI ISO CN27-2021 were executed after aging and sterilisation.  No degradation or non-conformities were observed (test sections 7.1-7.20).  Real-time stability is being tracked separately under protocol Doc-332257 for 2- and 5-year time points; the accelerated program to date supports the same shelf-life claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key stability outcomes  \n",
      "• All aged samples (up to 5 years equivalent) met leakage, burst, flow, displacement, particulate, tensile and welding-strength specifications.  \n",
      "• Visual inspection showed no gamma-induced slit closure even after 47.3 kGy (table 6.2.4).  \n",
      "• Functional performance of the new septum (Group F) was equivalent to, or slightly better than, the current septum control (Group C).  \n",
      "• Section 8.5 and Recommendation 10.1 establish a validated shelf life of five years for products containing septum PN 590422 after up to 42.8 kGy Gamma plus two EtO cycles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall conclusion  \n",
      "The new SILPURAN® 6000/50 A+B septum maintains full product functionality after worst-case sterilisation and five-year simulated aging.  A five-year shelf life is therefore recommended for all Elcam products that incorporate valve PN 590422.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Introduction  \n",
      "\n",
      "2.1 Purpose and Rationale  \n",
      "Dow Corning’s QP1-50 silicone, used in septum PN 590408, was discontinued.  Elcam therefore initiated Project 0695 to qualify the alternative SILPURAN® 6000/50 A+B material (septum PN 590422).  Because the septum is the primary seal, the study emphasised long-term stability under sterilisation and aging (sections 1.5–1.7 and 4.2).\n",
      "\n",
      "2.2 Product Description  \n",
      "The Stand-Alone NIP valve (product PN 220808L) consists of an MLLC base, a polycarbonate cap and the liquid-silicone-rubber septum.  It serves as a swabbable Luer-activated valve in various infusion devices (section 1.2).  Design, geometry and assembly processes remained unchanged; only the septum material was replaced (section 9.1).\n",
      "\n",
      "2.3 Study Scope  \n",
      "• Aging Conditions (section 4.7, table 4.7.3): 52 °C and 60 °C ovens, up to 245 days (5 years equivalent).  \n",
      "• Sterilisation (section 4.5): baseline 25 kGy Gamma + 2 EtO; challenge 40 kGy Gamma + 2 EtO.  \n",
      "• Samples: 17 groups, ~9 200 test pieces in total (table 6.7); the stability conclusion is based on the worst-case Group F5-5-60-EG.  \n",
      "• Tests: all septum-related clauses of AAMI ISO CN27-2021 Part 2 plus selected ISO 8536-4 mechanical tests (sections 7.1–7.20).  \n",
      "• Real-time stability: 2- and 5-year pulls defined in protocol Doc-332257 (section 4.9).  \n",
      "\n",
      "2.4 Regulatory / Standard Framework  \n",
      "The verification followed AAMI ISO CN27-2021 “General specification G-0090 for Luer-activated valves” and ISO 8536-4 where applicable (sections 2.1, 2.3, 4.2, 7.7, 7.18).\n",
      "\n",
      "2.5 Key Assumptions  \n",
      "• Arrhenius Q10 = 2.0 was applied for accelerated aging calculations (section 4.7.1).  \n",
      "• One dosimeter per test box provides ±5 % dose mapping accuracy (section 4.5.4).  \n",
      "• Acceptance criteria mirror those previously validated for the unchanged design; any aged group passing the full test matrix is sufficient evidence of stability (section 4.18.6).\n",

      "• Section 2.1 & 4 – demonstrate that changing the septum raw material from Dow-Corning QP1-50 to SILPURAN® 6000/50 A+B does not impair performance or safety.  \n",
      "• Prove compliance with Product Requirements Document and with AAMI ISO CN27-2021 “Luer-Activated Valves (LAVs)” after:  \n",
      "  – Worst-case sterilization (γ 40 kGy + 2 EtO cycles, §4.5).  \n",

      "  – Multiple clinical uses (140 activations, 11-day continuous use, §4.18.2).\n",

      "2. Key risk factors that could affect long-term stability  \n",
      "Identified in the product FMEA and echoed in §4.1 & Table 6.8:  \n",
      "• Loss of seal (air / liquid leakage) after ageing, irradiation, prolonged connection or activations.  \n",
      "• Tear or deformation of the slit (observed previously above 25 kGy with the old material – §12.1).  \n",
      "• Microbial ingress (swabability & barrier, §4.16).  \n",
      "• Mechanical failure of US weld, cap-to-base separation, burst, tensile or override forces.  \n",

      "     – Current septum QP1-50 → part 590408 / product 220808 (p.4 §4.11).  \n",
      "   • Use the specific manufacturing lots listed in the Group-ID table (e.g., 2403251640, 2402130846, …) – see pp.6-7 §6.4.  \n",

      "\n",
      "11. Material handling & interim storage  \n",
      "   • Until test initiation, packed boxes remain in normal production warehousing; no special storage atmosphere is required (p.4 §4.8 “Transportation simulation – NR”).  \n",
      "   • After sterilisation and before oven loading, samples are kept dry and at room temperature (implicit; not further detailed).\n",
      "\n",
      "12. Baseline measurements / initial characterisation  \n",
      "   • Perform visual inspection (30 pcs per main group) and dimensional measurement (4 pcs) BEFORE aging (pp.8, 11-12 §7.1-7.2).  \n",

      "15. Pre-start quality checks  \n",
      "   • Verify dosimeter placement, box count and labeling before irradiation (p.3 §4.5.4).  \n",
      "   • Confirm oven temperature / humidity are within limits before loading (p.4 §4.7).  \n",
      "   • Review that the correct Group codes and quantities match the sample-size matrix (§6.7) and that all data sheets are prepared.\n",
      "\n",
      "16. Special handling for the new silicone  \n",
      "   • No special storage or process changes are required; design and manufacturing parameters stay identical (p.24 §9.1). The only precaution is to segregate groups by material via the Group coding system A/B/C vs. F (pp.6-7).\n",
