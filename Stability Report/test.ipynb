Critical stability testing included accelerated aging at 52°C and 60°C for periods simulating up to 5 years, combined with sterilization exposure of up to 42.8 kGy gamma irradiation plus two ETO cycles. All functional performance tests passed successfully after 5-year equivalent aging, supporting a recommended shelf life of five years for products containing the new silicone valve material.',\n",
       " '## Introduction',\n",
       " \"The stability study was initiated due to Dow Corning's discontinuation of TSL097 Silicone QP1 50 LSR raw material, necessitating replacement with SILPURAN® 6000/50 A+B from Wacker for the NIP valve septum component. The study aimed to verify that products assembled with the new silicone material maintain functional performance over the intended shelf life.\",\n",
       " 'The scope encompassed accelerated aging studies simulating 1 month, 2 years, and 5 years of real-time aging, conducted at two temperature conditions (52°C and 60°C) with relative humidity of 50% ±5%. Multiple product groups underwent various sterilization combinations including gamma irradiation (25-40 kGy) and ETO cycles. Real-time aging studies at 2 and 5 years were also conducted in parallel according to stability test protocol Doc-332257.',\n",
       " \"The study followed Elcam's SOP# 3-01-39 based on ASTM F 1980 Rev 21, utilizing the Arrhenius reaction rate function with Q10=2.0, where 50 days at 52°C or 29 days at 60°C simulate one year of real-time aging at 23°C.\",\n",
